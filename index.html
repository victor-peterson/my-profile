		<h3>Sports 🎾</h3>
		<p>
			My main interest is sports, especially <b>Tennis</b> and <b>Football</b>. I started playing Tennis when I was only six years old with my father who introduced me to this incredible physical activity. After a few years of training, I started playing tournaments and dreamt of becoming a professional Tennis player. This has led me to participate in international competition and be the 520th best Tennis player of Switzerland.

			I love <b>Electro Dance Music (EDM)</b>. In fact it is the only type of music that I listen to. My favorite musicians, composers or DJs are <b>Martin Solveig, Kygo and David Guetta</b>. Also, my all time favorite song is Levels by Avicii but I also really like The Night Out by Martin Solveig which is a song about people hanging in Paris, where I currently live.
